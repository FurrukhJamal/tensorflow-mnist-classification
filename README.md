# MNIST Digits Calssification
A simple demo of classification of the mnist Digit Data set, where the MNIST data set is loaded and a model is learned and then random images from the dataset is selected and the model makes its prediction. You can also draw digits on your own. You might notice a drop in confidence level of predictions when the digits are drawn cuz of the way I implemented the drawing on canvas, it draws lines from one points to the next when the mouse is moved so at very low pixel level it would appear to be just zig zag lines to make predictions on instead of proper hand written digits on which the model was trained on. Clone the repo and you can run ```npm install``` followed by ```npm start``` to view the code in action.
